# PWM-LED-Control
For this project, you will use a potentiometer to read in an "analog" signal.  The value from the potentiometer must me normalized (be a value between 0 and 1).  From the normalized value, you will use it to set the "brightness" of a single LED utilizing the "pwmio" library.  Please remember that brightness is tied directly to the duty cycle of the PWM signal.

The basic premise is the potentiometer will control the brightness of the LED.

For this project, you will create a new repository in GitHub, save your code to GitHub and share the link to the specific repository as your submission.
